    <h2> SECTION 1</h2>
    <p>In the early 1980s, Richard Feynman proposed that a quantum computer
would be an effective tool with which to solve problems in physics
and chemistry, given that it is exponentially costly to simulate large
quantum systems with classical computers1
. Realizing Feynman’s vision
poses substantial experimental and theoretical challenges. First, can
a quantum system be engineered to perform a computation in a large
enough computational (Hilbert) space and with a low enough error
rate to provide a quantum speedup? Second, can we formulate a problem that is hard for a classical computer but easy for a
        quantum computer? By computing such a benchmark task on our superconducting  </p>
